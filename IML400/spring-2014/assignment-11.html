            <h2>Assignment 11: Final Project Landing Page (Iteration 1)</h2>
            <p>
                Individual assignment.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Landing Page is the content presented to the user once they visit a root URL. In the case of a single-page design, this will be the content filling the browser window prior to user interaction (known as above the fold).  
            </p>
            <p>
                This assignment requires the implementation of a first iteration of the Final Project Landing Page. All static content should be provided, as well as functional hyperlinks to placeholder pages or, in the case of a single page design, placeholder sections. Animations and effects are not required.
            </p>

                Next week we will host guest lecturer <a href="http://kevindriscoll.info/" target="blank">Kevin Driscoll</a>. Kevin is a Digital Archeologist and a PhD student here at USC. He will tell us about his research on Ted Nelson and Xanadu, a failed project that once had a chance to become an alternate reality for what we now call the World Wide Web.
            </p>
            Please read and write a report on Kevin's paper:
            <ul>   
                <li>
                    <a href="../fall-2012/readings/driscoll_dream_machines_iml400_draft.pdf" target="blank">Kevin Driscoll: Dream Machines</a> [Draft].
                </li>
            </ul>
            In order to get the best out of Kevin's lecture, you are recommended to refresh yout knowledge of three of your previous readings:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="../fall-2012/readings/bush_as_we_may_think.pdf" target="blank">Vannevar Bush: As we may think</a></li>

            </ul>
            And here are a couple more insightful articles where Kevin and author/scholar Finn Brunton touch upon the design of technologies that never where, and the impact these technological artifacts have in shaping an idea of the future:

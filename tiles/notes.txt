We will use the  developed by Responsive Environment Group at the MIT Media Lab. A 'plug' is a power  to profile power consumption strip with 4 sockets, augmented with sensors to measure and log current, voltage, ambient light, ambient sound and surface vibrations. Each plug has a radio that enables a close enough set of them to constitute a network.


We have looked at data retrieved by the <strong>Plug</strong> in the context of Pattern Recognition.


In this project we have looked at the data collected by the <strong>Plug</strong> in the context of Pattern Recognition.




*****************


We have used the Plug developed by the <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/resenv/">Responsive Environments Group</a> of the MIT Media Laboratory for this project. We have made an extensive analysis of the data collected by the Plug, in the context of Pattern Recognition.

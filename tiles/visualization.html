				<h1><strong>Visualization</strong></h1>
			</div>
				<p> 
					It became of essential importance to develop a set of visualization tools to understand the processes and results produced by our software, because human intuition is very good with visual information, but not so much when parsing lists of numeric data. It would have been impossible to check for bugs and errors in the output of a search if we didn't draw them. The illustration and sequence of lists that follow at the end of this section describe the same collection of 48 shapes that came out of a particular search. If the <a href="operations.html">fuse</a> procedure was not working well, perhaps producing a couple of self-overlapping shapes, it would have been impossible to detect this error looking at the raw data, but the visual renderings would have shown this immediately.								
				</p>
						<p> 
							We needed a real time connection with a graphics engine that could parse the data generated by Scheme, and show it to us on the fly. For that, we set up a Scheme server and used <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a>, a Java based graphics engine developed at the <a href="http://acg.media.mit.edu/">ACG</a>, to write a client that would take the coordinate data, rendering it in a draw loop over time. We designed a simple protocol to translate the coordinate information generated by Scheme into screen pixels. A small video of a search visualization and a few tiling visualizations can be seen <a href="video/tilings_0.mp4">here</a>.	We also included a collection of process screenshots from the visualization program in the <a href="gallery.html">Gallery</a> section.
